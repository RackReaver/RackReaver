**It all started when…**

I found myself inside the admissions office of New England Institute of Technology. My parents and the admissions officer both looked at me as I read through the program offerings. Reading one after the other something jumped out at me, I had never heard the term, “Cyber Security & Network Engineering”. The admissions officer noticed my curiosity and pulled out a class breakdown sheet, as I read each line my excitement grew, I knew this was my future.
